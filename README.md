# Synthetic Data Generation and Model Evaluation in R

This repository contains tools and functions in R for generating synthetic data and evaluating machine learning models using that synthetic data. Synthetic data generation is useful in situations where sharing or analyzing sensitive datasets while protecting individuals' privacy is necessary.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Functions for cleaning data, including removing null values, handling outliers, and normalizing data.
- **Modeling and Synthetic Data Generation**: Training machine learning models (e.g., linear regression) on cleaned data and using them to generate synthetic data preserving the statistical characteristics of the original dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of machine learning models on both original and synthetic data using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).
- **Data Visualization**: Tools for visualizing and comparing original and synthetic data, including histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

This repository is useful for researchers, data scientists, and privacy professionals working with sensitive datasets who wish to explore the use of synthetic data in their analyses and machine learning models.
